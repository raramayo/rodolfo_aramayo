My journey started with specialized training in Microbial Genetics, specifically Fungal Genetics, where I made a groundbreaking discovery in Epigenetics - the mechanism known as Meiotic Transvection/Silencing. This academic foundation merged seamlessly with my passion for computers, making me a unique hybrid: a Classical Geneticist and Molecular Biologist with deep expertise in Computational Genomics and Data Sciences. My strength lies in crafting algorithms that convert complex biological and genomics data into digital formats, facilitating integration with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I excel at deciphering complexity, translating innovative ideas into practical, reproducible algorithms, and scripting intricate tasks. I have extensive experience managing and working with computers and Supercomputers, including Next-Generation Sequencing data analysis, Genome Assembly, and Transcriptome Assembly and Quantification. I've successfully implemented sophisticated Bioinformatics tools and software, such as Jira and Galaxy, across various computing platforms. My commitment to education has given me substantial experience in simplifying complex genomic concepts for those new to the field, honed over years of teaching. My unwavering belief in teamwork is the foundation of my professional ethos.  Throughout my career, I've championed collaboration and nurtured growth-conducive environments. As a Principal Investigator, I've developed my leadership skills by guiding teams of undergraduate and graduate students, empowering them to turn research concepts into well-designed experiments, functional code, and rigorous testing. I firmly believe in the collective strength of a team, crucial for the success of any venture. In summary, I am a highly imaginative professional with an extensive interdisciplinary background. My expertise spans Genetics, the art of molecular manipulation of organisms\u2019 genomes. In addition, I am also proficient in genome and transcriptome assembly, and transcriptome quantification.  My role as a Principal Investigator has empowered me with the capacity to adeptly oversee and mentor teams of budding academics, aiding them in translating their research into actionable code and comprehensive testing. Moreover, my immersion in the industry as a consultant has sharpened my aptitude for discerning priorities.</p>"},{"location":"02_research/","title":"Research","text":"<p>My current research primarily focuses on understanding the organization, distribution, and comparison of information in Biological Systems.

Currently, our primary focus centers on the exploration of whether genes recognized for their significance in Meiotic Transvection/Silencing also contribute to the occurrence of Repeat Induced Point Mutation (RIP) phenomena.</p>"},{"location":"02_research/#computational-analysis","title":"Computational Analysis:","text":"<p>We are developing novel computational pipelines dedicated to detecting sequence variations within related genomes. We are particularly intrigued by the prospect of simplifying (i.e., digitizing) the information present in DNA, RNA, and Proteins so as to simplify its manipulation and analysis. We think that digitizing emerging genomic data will not only enable us to use this data effectively but also to integrate it into Artificial Intelligence, Data Clustering, and Image Recognition Algorithms, in ways not done before. We posit that this process of converting biological features into digital equivalents has the potential to simplify genomic information, making it easier to uncover previously unnoticed patterns through complex computational comparisons. This approach has already yielded promising results by revealing unexpected informational patterns across various organisms' chromosomes. We believe that it will streamline and enhance our ability to comprehend different cellular and organismal states. Moreover, it holds significant promise in revolutionizing our understanding of diseases, particularly Cancer and Metagenomics. This informational perspective also contributes to our comprehension of genome evolution, especially in the field of comparative genomics and microbial metagenomics.</p>"},{"location":"03_teaching/","title":"Teaching","text":""},{"location":"03_teaching/#courses-developed","title":"Courses Developed","text":""},{"location":"03_teaching/#computational-genomics-and-genomics","title":"Computational Genomics and Genomics","text":"<p>Both, Computational Genomics (undergraduate level) and Genomics (graduate level), are courses designed to prepare students for the Genomics Revolution. They both provide a broad, basic understanding of the different approaches used in the acquisition and study of genome data. Students learn how to obtain, organize, manipulate, and process biological data, using local-, super- and cloud-computers. For this, we use web-interface-based computational tools like Galaxy and CyVerse, to study genome data. Both courses aim at preparing students to understand and to perform basic genome analysis, which will in turn prepare them to follow and understand the most up-to-date work performed in biology. Computational Genomics_ and Genomics make extensive use of XSEDE and Jetstream cloud computational resources.

This course aims at developing terminal-based skills to obtain, organize, manipulate, and process biological data, with a focus on mapping and assembly of transcriptome data. Students learn the fundamentals of version control, scripting, text manipulation, and emerging computational tools available on local computers, super computers, and in the cloud. Learning the fundamentals of Version Control (GIT), scripting (BASH), text manipulation (SED/AWK), as well as other essential Genomics tools including, but not restricted to SAM, BED and Picard, allows students to ask and answer important biologically relevant questions. This helps them design, perform and analyze experiments using Mapping and Assembling software available at Cyverse and the TAMU Supercomputer Grace.

The course is based on the study of the use of genetic approaches to understand basic biological processes and genetic processes in both small (e.g., fungi) and large (e.g., mouse) eukaryotic organisms. In addition, we study classical examples where a non-mendelian genetic segregation is observed. In particular, we explore the exploding literature in the RNA silencing field, paying particular attention to the biology of the newly discovered non-coding RNAs. Students are exposed to the most up-to-date molecular and genetic literature in these fields. At the end of the course, students are expected to have an advanced understanding of the genetic and epigenetics of the most important eukaryotic model organisms and of the most relevant epigenetic problems.</p>"},{"location":"03_teaching/#information-in-biology","title":"Information In Biology","text":"<p>This undergraduate and graduate level course was an attempt to tackle a heavily interdisciplinary subject.
